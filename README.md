## BitcoinArtAttack

### Generative art based on the work of Dan Gries - [Rectangle World](http://rectangleworld.com/blog/about)

## What's it do

- Attempts to find the private key of an arbitrary bitcoin wallet
- Keeps a log of the closest matches. Anytime a closer match is found, a sweeping fractal is rendered
using the attempted private key.
